### Hi there, I'm Soan Kim. 👋

**AI Researcher & Systems Builder | Ph.D. Candidate in Reinforcement Learning & Neuroscience**

I sit at the intersection of **Theoretical Reinforcement Learning** and **Closed-Loop Systems Engineering**. My work focuses on building resource-rational agents that can reason, reflect, and adapt in sparse-reward environments.

---

### 🔭 Current Focus: The AI Scientist
I am building **metacognitive architectures**—AI systems that don't just solve tasks but monitor their own uncertainty to allocate compute efficiently.

* **Dual-Process RL:** Modeling the arbitration between fast heuristics (System 1) and costly planning (System 2).
* **Closed-Loop Pipelines:** Architecting real-time fMRI neurofeedback systems that couple biological substrates with autonomous agents.
* **Sparse Reward Learning:** Developing "Insight" mechanisms that allow agents to discover structural shortcuts when external feedback is removed.

### 🛠️ Featured Projects

#### 🧠 [Sparse-Reward-RL-Metacontroller](https://github.com/SoanKim/Sparse-Reward-RL-Metacontroller)
> *A modular RL framework for modeling metacognitive control.*
* **The Build:** A custom **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** engine integrated with a Model-Free heuristic agent.
* **The Tech:** Implemented a **"Singleton Latch"** mechanism for one-shot schema induction and a parallelized Bayesian optimization pipeline (`scikit-optimize`) for parameter fitting.
* **The Result:** Validated against human behavioral data ($N=49$), proving that "Insight" acts as a structural gatekeeper for resource-rational control.

#### 🎮 [Mathematical Problem-Solving via DQN](https://github.com/SoanKim/SET)
> *End-to-end Deep RL agent for abstract reasoning.*
* **The Build:** Architected a custom OpenAI Gym-compatible environment for the card game SET.
* **The Tech:** Trained a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** to navigate high-dimensional state spaces, optimizing for optimal solution paths.

#### 🔄 Real-Time Decoded Neurofeedback (Closed Source/Lab)
> *Real-time signal processing pipeline for causal neural modulation.*
* **The Build:** Engineered a closed-loop system that decodes fMRI patterns in real-time (MVPA) to induce reward prediction errors in human subjects.
* **The Impact:** Demonstrated a causal link between induced neural states and improved problem-solving performance.
